### **The Five-Note Relationship Arc**  
1. **Base Emotions** – The character’s starting emotional state toward the other person in the current phase of their relationship.  
2. **Emerging Emotions** – The emotional shift that redefines the relationship and introduces potential for change.  
3. **Awareness** – The character becomes aware of the shift.  
4. **Choice** – The character chooses to embrace the shift (or not).  
5. **Expression** – The character expresses their choice to the other character.  

- **Both (or all) characters go through the notes, or notably decline to.**  
- **The arc becomes romantic if the shift is into romantic feelings.**  
- Romantic feelings are **intuitively identifiable** rather than rigidly defined.  

### **Key Changes and Relationship Evolution**  
- **Key Changes can introduce a completely different emotional context, rather than just solidifying the previous shift.**  
- A **new Base Emotion** after a Key Change **does not have to be the previous phase’s Emerging Emotion.**  
- Instead, **the shift can introduce an entirely new dynamic**—for example:  
  - In **Phase 2**, Padmé was moving between **Base Hesitation** and **Emerging Acceptance.**  
  - In **Phase 3**, her Base became **Focus Elsewhere**, with an Emerging **Concern.**  
- This accounts for relationships that **evolve unpredictably**, rather than following a linear emotional progression.  

### **Refinement of 'Beat' to 'Note' & Repeating Notes Within a Phase**  
- The five categories **are distinct types of moments** but can **repeat multiple times** throughout a long relationship.  
- The model represents **the minimum required for a successful arc**, but these moments can **occur again in different contexts.**  
- 'Note' conveys **recurring emotional shifts** rather than a strict sequence.  
- A relationship must **progress through all five notes** to reach resolution, much like a **pentatonic scale in music.**  
- There can be **many beats of the same note**, reinforcing that relationships often experience repeated motions of the same type.  
- **A relationship does not have to move to a new phase immediately—characters can cycle through the same note multiple times before progressing.**  
  - **Example:**  
    - Xena & Gabrielle **repeat multiple moments of Choice and Expression before their final arc shift.**  
    - Mulder & Scully **go through repeated cycles of Awareness and Choice before finally acting on their feelings.**  
- This allows for **slow burns, back-and-forth dynamics, and relationships that take years to evolve.**  
- **The Five Notes are the minimum required for a full arc, but they can occur multiple times before a Key Change happens.**
